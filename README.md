# custom-unsplash-new-tab

remade the unsplash new tab chrome extension.

mostly made for a blog post on Learn.co

uses the fetch api which is currently available in Chrome and Safari (10.1+), but polyfilled just in case.

## The Set Up
1. install node modules: `$ npm --prefix ./source/js install ./source/js`

2. run webpack: `$ npm run --prefix source/js build`

3. you're now off to the races!

4. (optional) CodeKit for compiling SASS, and Jade(Pug)
